            The short answer is, "Sure do!". My journey into web development
            started officially on January 16, 2018. I don't have a ton of
            uninterrupted free time (damn toddlers...), so I decided to focus on
            learning code prior to focusing on the visual elements that are
            obviously necessary for an aesthetically pleasing website. Once I
            feel my grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is strong enough, I will
            start educating myself on the basics of graphic design so I can
            update this portfolio and get rid of this disclaimer. Until then,
            embrace the ugly!

            Profesionally, I am (was?) a forensic DNA analyst with extensive
            experience in casework and validations. I have worked in public,
            private, and federal labs, including a year running DNA in a
            glorified shipping container in Afghanistan. I have extensive
            experience with many different DNA technologies and methodologies
            and excel at troubleshooting data with unexpected results. If
            something goes wrong, I am usually the first person to be consulted.

            Personally, I am a 34 year old man-child who excels in
            self-deprecation, beard growing, and sarcasm (you have been warned).
            I am fueled by Diet Coke, chicken parm, and Reeses. I am an avid
            supporter of the Oxford comma. I grew up in New Jersey and have
            lived in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Utah, Colorado, and Kansas. Hobbies
            include playing (though my wife will argue it is more 'collecting')
            guitar, golf, snowboarding, ice hockey, photography, and driving my
            Jeep as far off the road as I legally can.
