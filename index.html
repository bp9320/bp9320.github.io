          <p class="disclaimer__paragraph">The short answer is, "Sure do!". My journey into web development started officially on January 16, 2018. I don't have a ton of uninterrupted free time (damn toddlers...), so I decided to focus on learning code prior to focusing on the visual elements that are obviously necessary for an aesthetically pleasing website. Once I feel my grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is strong enough, I will start educating myself on the basics of graphic design so I can update this portfolio and get rid of this disclaimer. Until then, embrace the ugly!</p>

          <h2 class="aboutMe__title">Who is Brian Pirot?</h2>
          <p class="aboutMe__paragraph">Profesionally, I am (was?) a forensic DNA analyst with extensive experience in casework and validations. I have worked in public, private, and federal labs, including a year running DNA in a glorified shipping container in Afghanistan. I have extensive experience with many different DNA technologies and methodologies and excel at troubleshooting data with unexpected results. If something goes wrong, I am usually the first person to be consulted.</p>

          <p class="aboutMe__paragraph">Personally, I am a 32 year old man-child who excels in self-deprecation, beard growing, and sarcasm (you have been warned). I am fueled by Diet Coke, chicken parm, and Reeses. I am an avid supporter of the Oxford comma. I grew up in New Jersey and have lived in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Utah, Colorado, and Kansas. Hobbies include playing (though my wife will argue it is more 'collecting') guitar, golf, snowboarding, ice hockey, photography, and driving my Jeep as far off the road as I legally can.</p>

I may not know the properties needed to create a certain effect off the top of my head, but I am confident in my ability to find them.

I understand the syntax and expected formatting, and am experimenting with modular scss files. I am comfortable creating and using varibles, mixins, and placeholder classes, though I may not always recognize all instances were I can use these features. I understand the concepts of loops and conditionals, but need to do some more reading up on them before feeling comfortable using them in a project.</span></h2>
